# pheno-by-geno-l1-and-l2
Predicting phenotype by genotype: a comparison of lasso and ridge regularized regression
# Introduction
The research goal of this study is to model, evaluate and compare the power of machine
learning models to predict the phenotype given the genotype. The models which will be
compared against each other include the polygenetic linear model, L1 (LASSO) regularization
and L2 (Ridge) regularization. (Long et al., 2013) developed a tool called JAWAMix5 which is
used for genome-wide association mapping. The JawaMix5 tool embeds the emmax
function and is well-suited to the format of the input genotype file. The tool will enable the
narrowing down of total SNPs (214,553) to identify the candidate SNPs for evaluating
models.
